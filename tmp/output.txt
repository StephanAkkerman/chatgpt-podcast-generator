### âœ… Bottom Line

Todayâ€™s market sell-off was driven by a rush of trade-policy escalation and disappointing U.S. jobs data, reversing earlier gains from strong tech earnings.

Macro-headline risk is sky-highâ€”traders are now bracing for accelerated volatility as multiple policies and data points unfold in coming days.
